## About
Our team aims to develop a user location tracking and monitoring system for our project using the Raspberry Pi Pico W configured as a Mesh-connected rogue access point (AP). This system is designed for scenarios where users voluntarily participate and provide consent for tracking. It can have various applications, such as tracking people within a campus. Here is a scenario of how the Pico should function:

COMPONENTS: Raspberry Pi Pico W, ESP-01, ESP32, and LoRa transceiver modules (Min 2) are required.
