# ESP32 Wi-Fi Penetration Tool

This project introduces an universal tool for ESP32 platform for implementing various Wi-Fi attacks. It provides some common functionality that is commonly used in Wi-Fi attacks and makes implementing new attacks a bit simpler. It also includes Wi-Fi attacks itself like capturing PMKIDs from handshakes, or handshakes themselves by different methods like starting rogue duplicated AP or sending deauthentication frames directly, etc...

## Features
- **PMKID capture**
- **WPA/WPA2 handshake capture** and parsing
- **Deauthentication attacks** using various methods
- **Denial of Service attacks**
- Formatting captured traffic into **PCAP format**
- Parsing captured handshakes into **HCCAPX file** ready to be cracked by Hashcat
- Passive handshake sniffing
- Easily extensible framework for new attacks implementations
- Management AP for easy configuration on the go using smartphone for example


## Usage
1. Power ESP32
2. Connect to this AP
By default: 
*SSID:* `ManagementAP` and *password:* `mgmtadmin`
3. In browser open `192.168.4.1`
